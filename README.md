# Nile River Basin Simulation with MONES

## Description
Nile River Basin simulation compatible with the [Gymnasium framework](https://gymnasium.farama.org/). With MONES algorithm connected to it.

The simulation was rewritten from paper of [Yassin Sari, 2022](https://github.com/ysari97/master-thesis-project). The MONES implementation is used from [here](https://gitlab.ai.vub.ac.be/mreymond/morl-guide/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads). Additional parallelism is added to speed it up.

## Usage
To run the simulation go to `water_management.py` file. There you can find functions for training agents, running already trained agents or visualising results from the train runs.
